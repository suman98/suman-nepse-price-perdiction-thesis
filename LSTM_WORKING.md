# Understanding LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for Stock Price Prediction

## What is LSTM?
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle time series data by remembering past information and deciding what to forget or keep. It’s particularly useful for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

### Purpose:
Predicts the next value in a sequence (e.g., tomorrow’s stock price) based on past values.

### Key Components:
1. **Forget Gate** – Decides what information to discard from the past.
2. **Input Gate** – Decides what new information to add.
3. **Output Gate** – Decides what to output as the prediction.
4. **Cell State** – Acts as a "memory" that carries information across time steps.

## Simple Example: Predicting Stock Prices

Imagine we have a tiny dataset of daily closing stock prices for 5 days, and we want to predict the price for Day 6. We’ll use a sequence length of 3 days to predict the next day.

### Dataset:
| Day  | Closing Price |
|------|--------------|
| 1    | 10           |
| 2    | 12           |
| 3    | 11           |
| 4    | 13           |
| 5    | 14           |

**Goal:** Use prices from Days 3, 4, and 5 (**11, 13, 14**) to predict Day 6.  
**Sequence Length:** 3 days.

## How LSTM Processes This

### Prepare Sequences:
The LSTM takes sequences of 3 days to predict the next day.

| Sequence Input  | Target Output |
|----------------|--------------|
| Day 1-3: [10, 12, 11] | Day 4: 13 |
| Day 2-4: [12, 11, 13] | Day 5: 14 |

LSTM processes the data step-by-step through its gates.

### Table: LSTM Processing Sequence [11, 13, 14] to Predict Day 6

| Time Step | Input (Price) | Forget Gate (What to Forget) | Input Gate (What to Add) | Cell State (Memory) | Output Gate (Prediction Basis) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| t=1       | 11           | Forget irrelevant past (e.g., noise) | Add 11 as relevant | Starts with 11 | Initial hidden state |
| t=2       | 13           | Keep trend from 11, forget outliers | Add 13 (upward trend) | Updates to 11 → 13 | Adjusts hidden state |
| t=3       | 14           | Keep 11→13 trend, forget old data | Add 14 (continue trend) | Updates to 13 → 14 | Final hidden state |
| t=4       | (Predict)    | -                             | -                        | Uses 11→13→14 trend | Predicts ~15 (upward trend) |

- **Forget Gate**: Retains the upward trend (11 → 13 → 14) and discards irrelevant noise.
- **Input Gate**: Adds each new price to the memory, building the trend.
- **Cell State**: Maintains the "memory" of the sequence (e.g., prices are increasing).
- **Output Gate**: Uses the final hidden state to predict the next value (e.g., ~15).

---

## How It Works Simply:
1. **Looking Back**: The LSTM sees the sequence [11, 13, 14] and notices the prices are increasing.
2. **Remembering**: It keeps this upward trend in its memory (cell state).
3. **Predicting**: Based on the trend, it guesses the next price will be slightly higher (e.g., 15).

## Training the LSTM
During training, the LSTM learns by adjusting its internal weights to minimize prediction errors.

- **Training Data:**  
  - `[10, 12, 11] → 13`
  - `[12, 11, 13] → 14`

- After training, it uses the last sequence `[11, 13, 14]` to predict Day 6.

### **Result**
- **Prediction:** The LSTM might predict ~15 for Day 6, assuming the upward trend continues.
- **Real-Life Complexity:** In stock prediction with sentiment analysis, LSTM would also consider sentiment scores (e.g., positive or negative news).

## Why LSTM Works for Stock Prediction
✔ **Memory:** It remembers trends over time (e.g., 60 days in your script).  
✔ **Context:** It uses multiple features (price, volume, sentiment) to make informed predictions.  
✔ **Flexibility:** It can adapt to patterns like sudden drops or steady increases.  

This is a simplified explanation—real LSTMs involve advanced math (sigmoid/tanh functions) and many parameters, but the core idea is capturing trends from sequences.
